# Template Helper

A [Magnolia CLI](https://docs.magnolia-cms.com/magnolia-cli) helper package for **@magnolia/cli-create-page-plugin** and **@magnolia/cli-create-component-plugin**

## Installation
**TemplateHelper** is included as a dependency in **@magnolia/cli-create-page-plugin** and **@magnolia/cli-create-component-plugin** and does not require separate installation.

## Integration with Magnolia CLI Plugins
**TemplateHelper** is integrated into Magnolia CLI plugins to:

- Facilitate the creation of apps and content types by automating repetitive tasks.
- Provide a consistent user experience across different plugins by centralizing common functionality.
- Avoid code duplication by reusing shared functions between **create-page** and **create-component**.
