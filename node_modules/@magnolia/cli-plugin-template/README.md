# PluginTemplate
A [Magnolia CLI](https://docs.magnolia-cms.com/magnolia-cli) package that provides a base `PluginTemplate` class for creating and handling plugins within the CLI Plugin System

## Installation
Each plugin package needs to have `@magnolia/cli-plugin-template` as a dependency. It's recommended to use the `generate-plugin` command to create a new plugin

### Using *generate-plugin*
1. Run the following command in an empty directory to create a new plugin:
   ```sh
   npx @magnolia/cli generate-plugin
   ```
   this command will generate new plugin's structure and install the `@magnolia/cli-plugin-template` automatically

### Manually
1. Run the following command in the new plugin's root directory:
   ```bash
   npm install @magnolia/cli-plugin-template
   ```
2. Ensure that your main class extends `PluginTemplate` and implements all of its abstract members
   ```javascript
   export default class <className> extends PluginTemplate {
   }
   ```

## Integration with Magnolia CLI Plugins
Every plugin in the CLI system must extend the `PluginTemplate`, which ensures consistent structure and functionality. The abstract class prescribes a common interface for all plugins, providing mandatory fields and functions each plugin must implement.

These include crucial information about the plugin, such as the plugin's `name`, `version`, and `description`, as well as fundamental operations like `start()`, `stop()`, and `init()` method for initializing logger passed from the MGNL CLI.
